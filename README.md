# Next.js 15 Upgrade Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when upgrading a Next.js 13 application to Next.js 15.  The issue stems from the introduction of the `app` directory as the default project structure in Next.js 15.  Older projects without an `app` directory may exhibit unexpected behavior or throw errors.

## Problem
A simple Next.js 13 application may fail to render or throw errors after upgrading to Next.js 15 due to the missing `app` directory and its required structure.

## Solution
The solution involves migrating the existing `pages` directory content to the `app` directory, adopting the new file-system-based routing, and potentially adjusting components and data fetching methods to align with the changes introduced in Next.js 15.
